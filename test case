%==========INPUT============= When the code is run in the command window the following inputs are to be entered:

>> YBUS
Enter number of buses :3
Enter the impedance from bus 1 to ground =  2+3i
Enter the impedance from bus 1 to bus 2 =  3+3i
Enter the impedance from bus 1 to bus 3 =  4
Enter the impedance from bus 2 to bus 1 =  4+7i
Enter the impedance from bus 2 to ground =  6
Enter the impedance from bus 2 to bus 3 =  7+3i
Enter the impedance from bus 3 to bus 1 =  3
Enter the impedance from bus 3 to bus 2 =  2+7i
Enter the impedance from bus 3 to ground =  3+8i

%=========OUTPUT============== The Y matrix is yeilded as follows::

Y =

   5.0000 + 6.0000i   0.0000 + 0.0000i   0.0000 + 0.0000i
   0.0000 + 0.0000i   0.0000 + 0.0000i   0.0000 + 0.0000i
   0.0000 + 0.0000i   0.0000 + 0.0000i   0.0000 + 0.0000i
