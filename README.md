FORMATION OF Y BUS MATRIX

Attached is a MATLAB code for generating an admittance matrix to be used for power flow problems in Computer Aided Power System Analysis. The matrix is a nxn matrix for a system having n number of buses. Each value gives the nodal admittance between the nodes determined by the coordinate number of the element in the matrix. For example, the value of the element in first row and second column would give the negative of the admittance between the buses 1 and 2.
